# PROJECT REPORT: MULTIPLICATION TABLE APP 
## Overview
<p>The Multiplication Table program is a Java application that displays the multiplication table from 1 to 12. The program uses nested for loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the table and the printf method to format the output so that each number takes up four spaces. This helps to align the columns of the table. The outer loop iterates from 1 to 12 to represent the rows, while the inner loop also iterates from 1 to 12 to represent the columns.
The purpose of the program is to provide a visual representation of the multiplication table for users. 
When you run the program, it will output the multiplication table in the console.
</p>

## PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
<p>The Java program is a console application that generates and displays a multiplication table from 1 to 12. The program uses nested for loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the multiplication table and displays the result in the console.
</p>

## FEATURES 

* The program displays the multiplication table from 1 to 12.
* The table is formatted with columns aligned using the printf method.
* The program runs in the console and outputs the table directly to the console.
### Instructions

1. Download the source code file for the program.
2. Open the file in a Java development environment, such as NetBeans, Eclipse, or IntelliJ IDEA.
3. Compile and run the program.
4. The multiplication table will be displayed in the console.

## PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
<p>The program consists of a single class named MultiplicationTable that contains a single static method named main. The main method is the entry point of the program and it contains the code to generate and display the multiplication table
</p>

<p>The main method uses two nested for loops to iterate through the rows and columns of the multiplication table. The outer loop iterates from 1 to 12 to represent the rows, while the inner loop also iterates from 1 to 12 to represent the columns.</p>
<p>The printf method is used to format the output so that each number takes up four spaces. This helps to align the columns of the table.</p>

When the program is executed, it outputs the multiplication table to the console.

## PROGRAM OUTPUT 
The output is well-formatted and easy to read, with each number taking up four spaces and the columns aligned. 

## CHALLENGES AND SOLUTION 
1. **Debugging while using the nested for loop:** A nested loop is a loop within a loop. The nested for loop was done at two levels and it was somewhat difficult to maintain. At some time, the counters got mixed up.

2. **Congestion of output**: After successful running of the code. It looked all congested. So, one of the teammates brought up the idea of forming a demarcation(Space) after each iteration so the output will be readable.

3. **Designing the user interface**: We needed to decide on the best way to display the multiplication tables to the user. This might involve using a console interface or a graphical user interface (GUI). The console interface was chosen by all members. 

## CONCLUSION
<p>The Java program is a simple yet effective way to generate and display a multiplication table from 1 to 12. The use of nested for loops and the printf method makes the program concise and efficient. The output is well-formatted and easy to read, making it a useful tool for anyone who needs to quickly generate a multiplication table.</p>
<p>Teamwork played out well in the implementation of this project, as everyone was delighted to contribute his quota</p>
